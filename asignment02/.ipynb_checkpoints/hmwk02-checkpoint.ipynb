    "Rigid transformation\n",
    "1 Tranformation - These are limited to translations or rotations. An image can be moved, or transformed,  \n",
    "while maintaining the spatial relationships within the matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "Example - A translation for example may add a parameter to each point. With the same amount being added\n",
    "to each value, the spatial relationships between each point are the same. The differences are where \n",
    "the tranformed matrix is placed in relation to a given axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Similarity metric - This is a measure to assess how similar or aligned two images are. This is a way\n",
    "to assess the quality of the transformation and can therefor be optimized for the third component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Entropy is a concept to describe the amount of information in a given variable, such as the \n",
    "distribution of intensities in an image. Joint entropy is a metric that examines the probability of \n",
    "an intensity representing one variable versus the other. It measures the uncertainty or randomness \n",
    "in two images examined together, i.e. jointly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Optimization - This is how the problem is solved so as to optimize the similarity matrix, or minimize\n",
    "the amount of entropy, using the terms in the example above. Given a transform T, we want to find the \n",
    "solution with the lowest possible difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Stochastic gradient descent is one possible approach to solve this problem. In a transform T,\n",
    "we may maximize the point where there is the steepest descent. T = arg max I(X, T(Y)) where I() \n",
    "represents a function of mutual shared information, a similarity metric. This may also be done\n",
    "by getting the partial derivative of a given cost function, and then finding the minima. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-rigid transformation\n",
    "1 Similarity Metric - This is the same concept as in rigid transformation, used to measure how well the \n",
    "two images align. The difference is that the similarity metric for non-rigid transform also accounts for local \n",
    "deformations like expansions, contractions, warping, and stretching/shearing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) is used for mono-modal registration. It measures the squared intensity \n",
    "difference between the images, assuming small differences are likely due to Gaussian noise on the intensities. \n",
    "It measures the residual error between the images assuming that noise in the intensity differences is\n",
    "normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Optimization - This is again similar to that in rigid transformation except more complex due to the \n",
    "additional degrees of freedom from local deformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the Demon's algorithm cited in class, one can use a gradient descent to optimize the SSD. Gradient descent  \n",
    "iteratively adjusts the displacement field to minimize the SSD (the residuals). The Demon's Algorithm approximates  \n",
    "the Hessian matrix (second order partial derivative instead of first order like in the Jacobian's Determinent), a measure\n",
    "of curvature in the image. This reduces computational burden. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Encoding of Deformation Field - Represents how local deformations are applied to the image. The \n",
    "deformation field needs to be flexible enough to capture complex differences while remaining smooth \n",
    "and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: B-splines are used to create smooth curves between control points. The image is divided into a grid of \n",
    "control points, and each point influences the surrounding area. Each control point anchors the influence of the deformation \n",
    "locally using smooth basis functions (B-splines) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Regularization - Introduces constraints on the deformation field to ensure that it remains smooth, \n",
    "realistic, and free of overfitting. It can prevent deformations such as folds or tears. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The Jacobian determinant, a first order partial derivative of the deformation field, monitors local volume \n",
    "changes induced by the deformation. A positive Jacobian ensures that the deformation is topology-preserving (no folding). \n",
    "Negative Jacobian values indicates a flipping of coordinates such as in folding or tearing, which regularization penalizes\n",
